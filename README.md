# CancelCancer

Project was developed by team Intelligence Creators (Dostavalov Igor, Ashirmatov Akmal, Yokubov Samandar) in the Hackathon Computer Vision AI Challenge.

The purpose of this project is to mitigate doctor's task to segment various malignant tumors on human's skin.

We used neural network, namely UNet, for image segmentation. Furthermore, sequential neural network was trained on labelled dataset of 9 types of skin tumors for 30 epochs and achieved almost 80% of accuracy on test dataset.
